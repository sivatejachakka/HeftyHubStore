# Hefty Book Hub

Hefty Book Hub is a simple E-Commerce website built using ASP.NET Core MVC(.NET 8). This was developed by following my online course on Udemy. I deployed the project in

The online course taught us on how to implement most common design pattern such as Repository Pattern or Generic Repository. To manipulate the data being fetched from the database, I learned also on how to use ORM or the Entity Framework in Dotnet Framework.

Main features/functionality of the web application as follows:

User Registration for different users(Admin, Customers)
User Authentications and Autherizations
Two-Factory Authentication with Facebook
Notify Customers for the products shipping status

Please see the source code in my github personal repository or visit the project itself live.
